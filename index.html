      Example Poem:
    <br />
      THE RAILWAY CHILDREN by Seamus Heaney
    <br />  
      When we climbed the slopes of the cutting
      We were eye-level with the white cups
      Of the telegraph poles and the sizzling wires.
    <br />  
      Like lovely freehand they curved for miles
      East and miles west beyond us, sagging
      Under their burden of swallows.
    <br /> 
      We were small and thought we knew nothing
      Worth knowing. We thought words travelled the wires
      In the shiny pouches of raindrops,
    <br />
      Each one seeded full with the light
      Of the sky, the gleam of the lines, and ourselves
      So infinitesimally scaled
    <br />
      We could stream through the eye of a needle.
